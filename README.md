# My First Smart Contract

This repository contains my first Solidity smart contract, created as part of the Solidity Programming 101 course.

## Part 1: Setting Up the Development Environment

Before writing the contract, I completed the following steps:

1. **Installed MetaMask:**
   - Downloaded the MetaMask extension for my browser.
   - Set up an Ethereum wallet and securely stored the seed phrase.

2. **Accessed Remix IDE:**
   - Opened Remix IDE in my browser.
   - Created a new workspace named "MyFirstSmartContract."
   - Created a new Solidity file named `SimpleStorage.sol` in the workspace.

## Part 2: Writing the Smart Contract

The next step was to write the smart contract following Lesson 1.3, Step 3. 

The contract includes:
- A state variable `favoriteNumber` of type `uint256` to store a number.

## Part 3: Compiling and Deploying the Contract Locally

To compile and deploy the contract, I:

1. **Compiled the Contract:**
   - Selected the Solidity Compiler in Remix.
   - Ensured the compiler version was compatible (pragma solidity ^0.8.25).
   - Clicked the Compile button to check for errors.

2. **Deployed the Contract Locally:**
   - Used the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
   - Selected the Remix VM (Cancun) environment.
   - Deployed the `SimpleStorage` contract and tested it locally.

## Part 4: Pushing Code to GitHub

1. **Connected Remix to GitHub:**
   - Integrated Remix with my GitHub account using the steps in the Remix settings.

2. **Created a GitHub Repository:**
   - Created a public repository named "MyFirstSmartContract."
   - Added the repository as a remote in Remix.
   - Committed and pushed the code to the repository.

## Part 5: Challenges Faced

While completing the project, I faced a few challenges:
- Connecting Remix to GitHub took some time, but the live session helped clarify the steps.
